    "### Blokus Isn't For Everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "We play more Blokus than other game in my home. (If Blokus is unfamiliar, [check out the rules and details here](http://www.charleston.k12.il.us/cms/teachers/teamred/games/blokus.pdf)). In this free-for-all four-player game, conflict naturally arises throughout gameplay. As a consequence, the conflict has weeded out some of our roommates which leaves just three players in the house who consistently play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three is Less Than Four\n",
    "\n",
    "Blokus can be played with three players. Each round, a different player takes a turn for the ghost fourth player, which will help simulate a four-player game. But this ghost fourth player only acts in the interests of the human making the move. Whenever it's my turn to move with the ghost player, I generally try to block one or two of the other housemates. It's as if I am playing with two colors for one turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This three player dynamic can be fun, and we have found tweaks that make the game more fair. However, **I wanted to try and produce a new playing experience where we have a fourth player playing to win for themself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of Blokus Gen 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main goal was to produce a program that could act as the fourth player in a Blokus game. These were the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The computer followed the game rules.\n",
    "2. Computer would be impartial even though I was tempted to program it to attack Sam at all costs.\n",
    "3. The computer would not disrupt the game flow. The computer play would not take too long or be too cumbersome to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**See below for a high level description of how these goals were accomplished.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow-Up Steps for Blokus Gen 2\n",
    "\n",
    "After a first wave of games played with Blokus Gen 1 (AKA Anna), we found that we were playing different games than what we had experienced with the traditional three-player format. However, Anna was so bad at game strategy that she was often exploited and out of moves around the midpoint of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "The GUI setup is not elegant. As is, it's sufficient, but some tweaks could make it easier for humans to read the moves played by Anna.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### These are the goals for Blokus Gen 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get Blokus Gen 2 to consistently play at least 15 pieces on the board. Currently at about 10 moves per game.\n",
    "2. Bolster user experience with GUI."

    "# How Blokus Gen 1 was Built\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 - Conceptualizing the Game Flow with a Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "We were not going to transition from playing Blokus as a board game to playing Blokus as a computer game. We like the social component of playing as a board game. In order to make the computer play, we would have to 1) manually input moves made from the board, 2) have the computer play a piece, and 3) have us manually place the computer's move onto the game board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, my experience with GUIs was limited so I was initially challenged with how this project would work. I was hoping the internet would come through with help. \n",
    "\n",
    "To my delight, the internet came through...well sort-of. From a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43432676/how-to-create-a-20x20-grid-of-tiles-in-tkinter-then-change-the-color-of-a-specif), pkqxdd had built a Blokus board with tkinter that would change color if one of the colors of the grids was clicked. See below for view of the grid and what happens with a click.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code did not solve everything, but it provided a roadmap for how the gameplay could work with the computer. We would be able to click in the pieces played by humans and then generate a move from the computer. The GUI component of the project was largely all set."
