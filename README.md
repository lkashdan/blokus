"# blokus" 

I built a computer player for the game Blokus. It is supposed to run again three human players, where the people add their placements into the tkinter GUI and then get the computer to spit out a move for their turn.

I'd recommend checking out the Jupyter Notebook for details on this project. Thanks, Luke.
